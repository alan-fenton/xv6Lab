Overall, this lab was not terribly difficult, taking significantly less time
than I had estimated. The most difficult thing we encountered was trying to
fully understand how the scheduler worked, as there were a few strange functions
used that weren't entirely obvious in what they were doing. However, this still
proved to not be terribly difficult.
Through experimentation, we found that the operating system has 2 CPU's. We
found this out because we set one of the lab3test processes to have a nice value
of 9, higher than the system calls, but we were still able to use ps. However,
when the nice value of a second lab3test process was set to 9, we were unable
to use the system calls as the processor was hogged by the lab3test processes.
